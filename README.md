# LAB 10a

## Chocolate Pizza Project

This project attempts to replicate img/preview.jpg as best as possible.


### Author: Tim Egorov, with help from Ryan Hoffman of Seatt-c-201d73. 

Ryan and I alternated as driver and navigator. Ryan was a great teammate and had some really great ideas, including using img/list-bg.png as a background element for our unordered list (rather than having the text float on top of list-bg.png as a separate image)

### Reflections and Comments

It was fun having a bunch of time to apply CSS. Labs are often JS-oriented, so it was great switching it up. We ran into a few issues, but overall, Ryan and I were very pleased with how things turned out. We could easily have sunk 5 more hours into this!
